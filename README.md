# Flatpak Sublime (Text & Merge)

This project packages **Sublime Text** and **Sublime Merge** in Flatpak format, with an automated workflow to easily build, install, uninstall, and clean up the environment.

## Project structure

- `builder.sh` → Build Flatpak packages (`.flatpak`) in `target/`.
- `cleaner.sh` → Cleans up the project and returns it to its initial state.
- `setup.sh` → Mini CLI application that centralizes all actions.
- `main/` → Manifestos and construction files.
- `target/` → Folder where bundles are generated (`sublime-text.flatpak`, `sublime-merge.flatpak`).

## Requirements

You need the following packages:

- curl, tar, rsync, and find.
- flatpak and flatpak-builder.

Depending on your Linux distribution, the installation method may vary, which is why it is not specified.

### Install the Freedesktop SDK 24.08

First, make sure you have Flathub configured as remote (if you haven't already):

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Then install the SDK:

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk//24.08
```

## Using `setup.sh`

You can perform all possible actions on the project by running:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

You can also run **builder.sh** and **cleaner.sh** individually. They are designed to depend on **setup.sh**, but use them for convenience.


## Common issues

### Git not working in Sublime Merge?

When installing Sublime Merge, it may not work as expected and you may get this in the console:

```bash
Result: failed with exit code 1
Result: failed with exit code 128
```

This is due to the sandbox nature of flatpak. To fix this, go to **Preferences** → **Advanced**.

In **Git Binary** and **SSH Path**, paste `/app/bin/git-host` and `/app/bin/ssh-host`. Then configure your authentication with Git via SSH.

### Why don't Sublime Text and Sublime Merge detect each other?

As mentioned above, they are isolated from each other, but you can configure them so that they work together.

In Sublime Merge, go to **Preferences** → **Editor**, then in **Editor Path** paste `/app/bin/subl`.

Now in Sublime Text, go to **Preferences** → **Settings** and paste the key `“sublime_merge_path”: “/app/bin/smerge”,`

## Additional notes

You can download the files manually from the official website by selecting the direct download of 64-bit .tar.xz. Once extracted, place all the contents in the **main/sublime-merge/files/** or **main/sublime-text/files/** folder and delete the _.desktop_ file you find.

You can package it with **builder.sh** or from **setup.sh** without any problems. This is useful if you want to have specific Sublime builds.

The scripts are all in Spanish except for the commented lines in the code. I was too lazy to put it in English, but if anyone complains, I might add multilingual support.

Remember that if the path where the icons are stored in the Icon/ folder or where the application is stored in the opt/ folder differs from the current one, this script will not work.

This was tested on: Sublime Text Build 4200 and Sublime Merge Build 2112.
